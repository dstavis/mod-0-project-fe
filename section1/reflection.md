## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

Answer: When I worked at Exygy, a consultancy in San Francisco, I was taught a toxic habit of avoiding asking questions of my engineering team lead. In fact, "how often I asked for help" was used as a criteria in my performance review, and if I asked for help more often than they thought I should be, I was given a worse score. Just another one of the reasons that environment was not a good fit. In class, I am often comfortable asking questions, as long as I feel as if there's enough time for everyone. If the instructor doesn't have time to answer everyone's questions or is rushed, what choice do I have but to hold my tongue? Otherwise, I enjoy asking follow-up questions until I fully comprehend a topic. I usually also re-state the final conclusion of what I learned to the person I was asking, just to make sure we agree that I understood what they meant.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
String, number, boolean
A string holds text, including letters numbers and symbols, including special characters. A number holds numbers, including negative numbers and floating point numbers, and does not use punctuation in large numbers. A boolean holds either true or false.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
//
/* */
A code comment is not executed when the file is run. It can be used for elucidation in natural language, or for temporarily deactivating a portion of code

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a container for data with a name, that acts as a label, and a value that can be assigned and changed later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

screenName, password, and followerCount might be used in an app like Instagram (though I doubt they use those exact names)
screenName would hold a string, so would password, and followerCount would hold a number

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the joining together of two things. In our case, it usually means joining one string to another using the + operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

When displaying a welcome message like "Welcome back, David!", I bet the developers used concatenation (or interpolation) to append a dynamic variable containing the user's name to the static string containing the welcome message.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Whew, okay, gotta have a question...Alright, how about this. Is a variable considered a data type?
