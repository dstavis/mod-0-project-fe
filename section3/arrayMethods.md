## Pop

Pop (when not passed an argument) removes the last item in an array from the array, and then returns that item.

## Push

Push expects an argument, and then adds the provided argument to the end of the array on which it was called. It returns a number indicating how long the array is now, after adding the new item.

## Shift

Shift is like pop but for the front of an array. It removes the item in the first slot of an array, and returns that item.

## Unshift

Unshift is like Push, but for the front of an array. Unshift takes the provided argument, and adds it in the first slot of the array it was called on. It returns the length of the array after the new item was added.
