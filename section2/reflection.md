## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

A: It was interesting, in the article, to hear the case made that learning programming can reinforce growth mindset thinking. The article claimed that because we often "fail" by writing and then running code that doesn't yet achieve the objective we have set out to solve, and then use the "failure" information to move towards our goal, and that is an example of how failure is safe and desirable and a step in the direction of success (rather than a target of shame), which is a growth mindset belief, therefore programming would naturally make a practitioner more growth mindset-y. I was surprised to read that, and I hope it's true!

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

A: I've adopted the point of view that if I have the time and resources to make enough attempts, with the right conditions, I am most likely able to succeed at most things that I would like to do, as long as I haven't phrased the goal in a way that makes it limited in a very specific way. Also, in my life, when I try one thing that doesn't work out, I might feel pessimistic if I don't have another idea for a solution. But as soon as I can think of one other thing that I could try, I remember that my goal is still possible, and I don't have to give up. Then I feel optimistic again. When I do feel hopeless, I intentionally try to spend time thinking of one different way that I haven't tried yet to solve the problem, and eventually I do tend to think of something. But even if I don't, I can tell myself "There's so much that exists in the world that I don't know about right now. If I get lucky, I may find out about a solution I couldn't have possibly known about yet. Or, if a solution doesn't currently exist, one might come into existence with time, and then I will be able to reach my goal."

How don't I demonstrate a Growth Mindset? Sometimes when what I'm doing isn't working, I can get frustrated. Really frustrated. So frustrated that I completely lose my will to engage with the project. That can derail my progress.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

A: It didn't bother me. Those actions are straightforward to me now, so if they had been there I simply would have skipped over them.


4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A: A conditional statement is a statement that only executes if its provided condition evaluates to true. One example in javascript is an if statement. One example could be, if (userLoggedIn){ displayProfileLink = true }

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

A: If you need multiple mutually exclusive conditions, you would follow the initial if statement with one or more else if statements, and optionally an else statement to catch any unspecified conditions.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

A: The && (AND) logical operator can check if both of two conditions are met. The || (OR) operator can check if one or more of the conditions is met.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

A: Is there an *exclusive or* operator? It would be similar to ||, but it would only return true if exactly one of the conditions was met, not two or more.
